# Mobile-Architect-Programming

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this project is to develop an inventory management app that allows users to track and manage items in their inventory. The app provides a user-friendly interface for adding, removing, and updating inventory items. Additionally, it includes user authentication functionality to ensure data security. The user needs for this app included: Creating an inventory database to add items. A delete function to remove items from a database along with Updating to change the value associated with individual database items. And lastly, the ability to view all of the database items displayed as a grid. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
UI Design
Login/Register Screen: This screen allows users to log in with their credentials or create a new account if they don't have one.

Inventory Grid Screen: This screen displays all the items in the inventory in a grid view. Each item will show its name, quantity, and additional details.

Add Item Screen: This screen enables users to add a new item to the inventory. It includes input fields for the item name, quantity, and other relevant details.
Remove Item & Confirmation Screen: When users want to remove an item from the inventory, a confirmation screen will be shown to ensure they intend to delete it.

Item Details Screen: This screen will display detailed information about a selected inventory item, including its name, quantity, and any additional details. It will also provide options to update the item's quantity.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Approaching the process of coding an app involves several techniques and strategies I applied. Some include:
1.	Define the app's requirements: Clearly understand the purpose, functionality, and target audience of the app. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.

2.	Plan the architecture: Design the overall structure and organization of the app considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

3.	Break down the development tasks: Divide the development process into smaller tasks or modules. 

4.	Follow coding best practices: Adhere to coding standards and best practices to ensure the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of the code. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure that the code was functional:
1.	Integration testing: Integration testing validates the interactions between different units or components of the code. It ensures that these components work together as intended and that the overall functionality of the system is not compromised.

2.	System testing: This type of testing evaluates the entire system or application as a whole. It checks if all components, features, and interactions work together seamlessly to achieve the desired functionality. 

3.	Acceptance testing: Acceptance tests are conducted to ensure that the developed software meets the specified requirements and satisfies the expectations of the end users.

4.	Regression testing: Regression testing is performed whenever code changes or updates are introduced to ensure the existing functionality remains intact. 

The testing process is important for several reasons:
1.	Detecting bugs and issues: Testing helps uncover software defects, logical errors, or unexpected behaviors. 
2.	Ensuring functionality: Testing verifies that the code behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.
3.	Enhancing software quality: Thorough testing improves the quality and reliability of software by catching and resolving issues early in the development cycle. 
4.	Facilitating maintenance and scalability: Well-tested code is easier to maintain and extend. 
The testing process reveals various aspects of the code, including:
1.	Bugs and defects: Testing helps identify and locate software defects or bugs that can cause malfunctions or unexpected behavior.
2.	Functional gaps: Testing reveals whether the code meets the functional requirements and specifications defined for the app.
3.	Integration issues: Integration testing exposes problems that can arise when different components or modules of the code interact, such as compatibility issues or incorrect data exchange.
4.	Performance bottlenecks: Testing can uncover performance-related issues like slow response times, excessive resource consumption, or scalability limitations.
5.	Usability and user experience: Testing provides insights into the app’s usability, highlighting areas needing improvement to enhance the user experience.
•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There were many areas I had to innovate to overcome challenges. Most of them were coding problems for the designs I wanted. It was difficult to implement a screen design you whiteboard or wireframed to actual code. I wanted the keyboard to not cover the screen layout when activated. I accomplished this on the login and notifications screens but not on the main screen because I had to use a scrolling layout to see all the information provided. There are improvements to the app that would eliminate this, such as moving the data entry to its own screen when the ADD button is pressed. 

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One area in which I was successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skill, and experience was in the layout of the inventory screen. It is difficult to design an Inventory screen with five columns wide to fit on a mobile screen. This is especially difficult when you do not know the length of the fields the user will use. For example, the length of the item name, part number, and location could be extensive. With limited screen space, I incorporated a scrolling screen to be able to see all fields.
